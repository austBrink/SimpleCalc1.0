# SimpleCalc1.0

Thanks for stopping by! This little programming demo was a first time java project by myself along with Phoenix Franco (github.com/ProjectsByPhoenix). Phoenix was very helpful in first tests, mapping out logic, and writing/implementing his own code. 

There are a number of future objectives for this project. 
However, let this serve as a very basic experiment with implementing JAVAFX GUI.

 future objectives 
*handle Exceptions (string inputs) 
*handle key pad events (ie ^ (carrot) => execution of the exponent node)
