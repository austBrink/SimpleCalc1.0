# SimpleCalc1.0

Thanks for stopping by!

This was my first official mini project to make a GUI equipped program in JAVA using JAVAFX. 
There are a number of future objectives for this project. 
However, let this serve as a very basic experiment with implementing JAVAFX GUI.

 future objectives 
*handle Exceptions (string inputs) 
*handle key pad events (ie ^ (carrot) => execution of the exponent node)
